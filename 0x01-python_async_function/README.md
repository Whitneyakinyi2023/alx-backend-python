# Async in Python
## Overview
Asynchronous programming allows for the execution of tasks without waiting for each to complete before starting the next. This can greatly improve the efficiency and performance of programs that involve I/O-bound operations, such as network requests or file I/O. Python's asyncio library provides the foundation for writing asynchronous code using async and await.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Installation
No additional installation is required as asyncio is included in the Python standard library. Simply ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed:

`` python --version``
## Key Concepts
async: Defines an asynchronous function that can use await within its body.
await: Pauses the execution of an async function until the awaited task completes.
asyncio: The core library for asynchronous programming in Python, providing event loops, coroutines, and tasks.
